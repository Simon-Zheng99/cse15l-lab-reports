# Lab Report 1

## cd:

![Image](cd1.png)

Using cd without any arguments will not cause a change in directory. This is not an error; it does not have a valid argument so it will remain in its current directory.

Using cd with a path to a directory will allow us to change directory and access the files inside. If we don't change directory, we are unable to access the files inside the lecture1 directory such as Hello.class or Hello.java.

Using cd with a path to a file will cause an error. A file is not a directory, so the cd command won't produce any useful results.

## ls

Using ls without any arguments will list out all the directories and files in your current directory. In this case, it will be our default directory, so the ls command will only display the lecture1 directory.

Using ls with a path to a directory lists out all directories and files under that specific directory. In this case, it prints out all the files under the directory first, then the "messages" folder.

Using ls with a path to a file will simply just list the file name. The ls command doesn't access the contents inside the file, it will only print the file name.

## cat
